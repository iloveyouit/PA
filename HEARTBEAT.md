# HEARTBEAT.md

# Keep this file empty (or with only comments) to skip heartbeat API calls.

# Add tasks below when you want the agent to check something periodically.

# Heartbeat policy: limit checks to once per calendar day to minimize token spend. Schedule follow-up tasks or reminders only when they truly need attention.

- Added OpenClaw Token Cost Optimization — Engineering Standard v2.0 guidelines for everyday awareness.
  - Session hygeine: execute /compact at 60% context usage, use atomic workflows, flush with /new, enable agents.defaults.compaction.memoryFlush.
  - Bootstrap minimization: keep injections lean, move procedural doc to skills, audit /context detail, target <5k tokens, 2KB rule, avoid heavy BOOTSTRAP.
  - Output constraint: avoid filler, no routine narration, use one-line status updates.
  - Heartbeat/cron architecture: avoid LLM polling, use scripts for monitoring, align heartbeat interval with cache TTL, run background tasks isolated.
  - Model routing: tiered models (flash-lite/haiku/sonnet/opus) per task complexity; spawn for deep debugging.
  - Tool outputs/sub-agent isolation: use sub-agents for heavy reads, limit log output, summary return.
  - Prompt caching: keep static headers, set cacheRetention long, avoid top-of-file edits.
  - Loop/runaway protection: 3-attempt max, set budget hard caps, keep attended mode 24h before always-on.
  - Extended thinking: keep thinking:false default except for complex tasks; monitor usage visibility via /usage.
